# Hello world example

A minimal `<Hello/>` world example using ReactJS **["stateless functions/components"](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/reusable-components.html#stateless-functions)** (*funciones puras* o *sin estado*).

## Start

1. Open the `config.json` file and edit `src` to `demos/hello_stateless/example`
2. Run `npm start` on the repo root.




Stateless functions/components are the most simplier component we can make in react. However simplier does not mean they are not powerfull. You can still set default props and use props validation.

Stateless components lack of any kind of state and like pure functions only rely on the properties they receives.

Stateless components should not mutate in any way the properties they receive neither cause any kind *side effects*.
